# Face-recognition
This face recognition project is developed using machine learning techniques. It is a classification problem which includes total fifteen
classes.(15 Celebrities). Various Machine Learning Algorithms used for project include: KNN, Naive Bayes - Bernoulli, Naive Bayes -
Gaussian, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. Out of these, the one with maximum accuracy is selected using
voting classifier.
